## The normal workflow

Normal translation workflow using the gettext-like infrastructure is:

    master data --+--> POT --[translation]--> PO --+
                  +--------------------------------+--> translated data

The POT data is automatically generated without human intervention from the
master data.  Let's call this functionality as the POT extractor. E.g.:

* xgettext (original tool by the gettext infrastructure covering strings in
  programs)
* po4a-gettextize without -l (from po4a covering SGML, DocBookXML, ...)
* itstool with -j (from itstool covering XML)
* sphinx.builders.gettext (MessageCatalogBuilder class in Sphinx covering RST)

The human translator adds the translation data to the POT data to make the PO
data.

The PO data can be automatically updated by the updated POT data using msgmerge
when the master data is updated.

The translated data can be generated by the updated PO data and the master
data. (Sometimes the PO data may need to be converted to the MO format by
msgfmt.)

* gettext() (embedded function by the gettext infrastructure, alias is _())
* po4a-translate (extension tool po4a generating l10n SGML, DocBookXML, ...)
* itstool with -m (extension tool itstool generating l10n XML)
* ??? (Sphinx may be converting directly to the final format data such html for
  each l10n targets from the combination of the master data and the PO data
  without generating l10n RST source.)

This workflow helps to keep up translated output in sync with the master
output.

## The reverse workflow

When you decide to change data format, migration of the PO data is a
non-trivial task even if there is a good conversion tool from the data format
to the new ones.  We need a reverse workflow to generate the PO data from the
master data and the corresponding translated data for any gettext derivative
infrastructure.

This po_combine provides a generic reverse workflow as follows:

    master data ------> POT --+
                              +--[po_combine] --> PO
    translated data --> POT --+

* the POT extractor of each tool infrastructure creates the master POT data by
  placing the converted master data in the normal master data position.
* the POT extractor of each tool infrastructure creates the translated POT data
  by placing the converted translated data in the normal master data position.
* Manually edit the converted master POT data and translated POT data to align
  and match exactly.
* the PO data generator po_combine creates the converted PO data from the
  master POT data and translated POT data.

When the master and translated data doesn't use PO system and you want to
migrate to PO based source structure, po_combine is a great help.  I find the
requirement to align and match the master data and the translated data in their
original format is more trouble than doing it on the POT data.  This is very
true when the translated data is based on older master data with many mussing
paragraphs.  For such cases, I see some advantage of po_combine over native PO
generation mechanism such as po4a-gettextize with -l option for po4a.

You can add some extracted markers such as untranslated strings (numbers,
embedded XML tags, ...) to the comment section of POT file before manually edit
them for alignment. This kind of marker strings and the original POT markers
such as "#. type: Content of: <book><chapter><title>" should make the align and
match task easier with this po_combine workflow.  (TODO: In future, adding
consecutive extraction index number instead of just source line position may be
added to help this process.)

When you are migrating from an old data format to a new data format with some
conversion program, po_combine can help you to create updated PO file
corresponding to the new translated data with its generic workflow.  The
alignment in the old data format is an optional task if you take this path.
But the better alignment in the old data format reduces the manual alignment
work on the new data format.  For the better alignment in the old format,
disabling features such as ones provided by the add_.../ files or any other
ways to insert translator credits or similar in the old source ensures better
matched old source data.

When multiple similar original strings are translated into a same translated
string, even the perfectly aligned new original and translated data can't be
handled well by po_combine.  If the number of extracted strings for the
translation is less than the original for seemingly perfectly aligned data,
this is probably the reason.  Then the use of native PO generation mechanism
such as po4a-gettextize with -l option for po4a may have some advantage over
the use of po_combine.  (Also, for poxml, split2po facilitates this
functionality.)  You need to un-fuzzy resulting PO.

TIP: pandoc is a nice document data format conversion tool.
